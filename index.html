            <li><p>Microsoft Office<br/>
                Through many years of personal and professional use of microsoft office software, I have been able to gain a variety of skills and proficiency in use of the excel and database softwares. 
                I enjoy using these tools to manage and organise data and vaarious information and also have found enjoyment in utilising and learning about the use of VB scripts and other advanced functions. 
                In work this was shown through the use of excel to create tables and checklists for the organisation and management of the BOMs that were being managed by the team I was working as a part of. 
                In my personal time I also enjoy utilising excel and databases for the organisation and tracking of collections and progression in hobbies that can be tracked in this way. 
                With further training in SQL and Python I plan to produce applications to allow for cleaner and more efficient running of the my personal spreadsheets and databases and also for use in work 
                environments where doing so would provide some benefit that is not already being met by the use of other project management tools.
