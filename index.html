    <h2>Resume</h2>
    <p >
        I am an electronics engineer by education and experience who is now training and working on building knowledge and experience in full stack web development. During my work on electronics career I found that I am much more driven by work
        on code based projects that are disconnected from hardware and find a lot of enjoyment in the process of producing a solution to a problem or something entirely new to meet a specification through 
        the use of the logic tools provided by programming and markup languages. In my engineering career I have been able to work on team projects to tight deadlines aided by the use of project 
        management and work tracking tools such as Jira.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Web Development<br/>
                From working with programming and markup languages in my engineering career, I grew to enjoy the process of producing, reviewing, fault finding and running code to be able to produce tools,
                understand the functions of electronic products and learn how to do these things more efficiently and proficiently. Through training, I am able to understand the process of web development 
                and appreciate the complexity of websites that I had been viewing and using and grew further curious to the workings and the extent of what could be done with the combination of markup languages
                and programming languages to create a variety of unique and interesting functions and designs through the use of the same basic skills and languages that I had been using lightly in my professional
                career in engineering. I have been slowly building my knowledge through training courses and through investigation of websites I find interesting and plan to apply the knowledge I obtain in personal
                interest projects and as a professional interest going forward. I am currently capable of producing HTML web pages and am training in the use of CSS with training on Javascript to come after along with
                advanced applications of the combination of these languages to produce complex and intuitive websites.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Python and C Programming<br/>
                Through working on a variety of tools and embedded software alongside formal education in the writing and understanding of C and Python, I have been able to create, maintain and improve upon
                code being used in a professional environment to automate the creation of technical drawings, perform advanced electronic functions in electronic assemblies and to communicate between computers and
                electronic devices through a variety of communication protocols. I am able to read a variety of coding languages and can also effectively research to be able to identify faults in code and
                intended functions so that I can produce updates that allow for correct functionality while keeping to internal and general coding practices. In my free time I have also been able to apply these skills
                in order to create tools to allow for the implementation of web searching functions and video and audio playback in calls on a popular communication application.
                </p>
            </li>           
            <li><p>Microsoft Office<br/>
                Through many years of personal and professional use of Microsoft office software, I have been able to gain a variety of skills and proficiency in use of the excel and database softwares. 
                I enjoy using these tools to manage and organise data and various information and also have found enjoyment in utilising and learning about the use of VB scripts and other advanced functions. 
                In work this was shown through the use of excel to create tables and checklists for the organisation and management of the BOMs that were being managed by the team I was working as a part of. 
                In my personal time I also enjoy utilising excel and databases for the organisation and tracking of collections and progression in hobbies that can be tracked in this way. 
                With further training and experience in SQL, C and Python I plan to produce applications to allow for cleaner and more efficient running of the my personal spreadsheets and databases and also for use in work 
                environments where doing so would provide some benefit that is not already being met by the use of other project management tools.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Team Working<br/>
                From working in team environments for over 10 years through work I have been able to appreciate and understand the team working dynamic. In my engineering work, I was involved in a large number of small continuous improvement
                projects that required a small team of people with varying competencies to review processes and products internally, identify areas for improvement, produce solutions and implement and monitor the improvements of the decided upon solution.
                In this process, I was able to demonstrate my ability to offer assistance to others, trust in the work to be done by others in the team, and ability to work as a team to identify issues and create solutions.
                This process was also a part of my generic work duties but I believe it is more evident when done in a group of diverse competencies. In my free time I have been able to show my team working capabilities through the participation and
                input into the touch rugby team I was a part of. I was required to work as a team to communicate effectively in tense situations, plan effectively for matches based on available resource and work in a way to
                allow for individual strengths of team members to be effectively utilised.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Time Management<br/>
                Having worked in a professional large scale engineering company for over 10 years and undergone various educational training courses, I have been able to prove that I am capable of working to
                deadlines and manage my workload and keep track of projects and work that I have been required to complete to a variety of lengths of deadlines. When the engineering team I was a part of shifted
                to a project management system to manage work and adopted the sprint/agile working methods, I was able to quickly adapt to this working method and welcomed the change to regular progress tracking
                and breaking down of projects in to smaller tasks achievable in 2 week buckets as this was a way of working I was already following but on a personal work management level with college, university
                and personal projects.
